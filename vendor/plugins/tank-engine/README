Example
=======

This plugin uses jQuery to manage it's JavaScript needs. The jRails plugin
(http://ennerchi.com/projects/jrails) is recommended -- it converts Rails
Prototype/Scriptaculous helpers to jQuery.

After installing the plugin, perform

rake tank_engine:install

to copy the public assets (images, javascript, and CSS) to the public folder.

Tank engine places an iPhone layout file in app/views/layouts/application.iphone.erb.

Controller Usage
================

The module ActionController::IphoneController adds support for recognizing
Mobile Safari as the :iphone pseudo-MIME type. 

In your controller (can be ApplicationController) add the line

acts_as_iphone_controller

By default, the following requests are redirected to the iphone format.

* Requests with a user agent including "Mobile Safari". To change this 
default, pass the option :ignore_iphone_user_agent => true to 
acts_as_iphone_controller.

* Requests which end in ".iphone". To change this default, pass the option
:format => <YOURFORMAT> to acts_as_iphone_controller.

* Requests to a subdomain "iphone". To change this default, pass the option
:subdomain => <YOURFORMAT> to acts_as_iphone_controller.

The option :test_mode => true will cause all requests to be treated as iPhone
requests.

To capture these requests, you can use :iphone as part of a respond_to block:

respond_to do |format|
  format.html # show.html.erb
  format.xml  { render :xml => @feature }
  format.iphone
end

The file extension for the view is .iphone.erb

The module TankEngineHelper provides a number of helper methods for creating
iPhone structures in your views.

When this plugin is installed, form builders have a new helper "toggle" that
creates an iPhone style toggle switch.
