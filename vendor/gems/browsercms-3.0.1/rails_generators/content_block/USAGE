Description:
    Stubs out a new content block. Pass the content block name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'. The name:string
    attribute is also implicitly generated as part of the migration and to the forms,
    but you can override it by specifying a different type, like name:text.

    This generates a model, controller, several partial views, a migration and tests
    in the appropriate directories.

Examples:
    `./script/generate content_block article`

        creates an Article model, controller, views, tests, and migration:
            Model:              app/models/article.rb
            Unit Test:          test/unit/models/article_test.rb
            Migration:          db/migrate/XXX_create_article.rb
            Controller:         app/controllers/cms/article_controller.rb
            Functional Test:    test/functional/cms/article_controler_test.rb
            Form Partials:      app/views/cms/articles/_form.html.erb
                                app/views/cms/articles/render.html.erb

        This block will have a single attribute, name:string and a form with text_field
        to edit the name.

    `./script/generate content_block Article name:string body:text published:boolean`

        creates an Article model with a string name, text body, and published flag.
        It will create form fields for these attributes in _form.html.erb.
